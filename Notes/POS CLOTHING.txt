POS CLOTHING

- Size
- http://localhost:3000/owner/inventory/stocks/new-stock (multiple choice shop branch at Shop)
- need to add wholesale tire with hide button

I would like to build POS system specific for Clothing-store.

I want to use Next.js (AppRouter, typescript) and Firebase.

We will have to implement 2 sides, buyer and seller.

Let's implement Authentication for both Buyer and Seller side only frontend with simple and clean code, also don't forget ESLint and Type and syntax error.

###  Example with Your Test Transaction
Let's say you have a transaction with:

- Item 1 : THB 500 × 2 = THB 1,000
- Item 2 : THB 250 × 1 = THB 250
- Subtotal : THB 1,250
- Cart Discount : THB 107.50 (8.6%)
- Final Amount : THB 1,142.50
If you refund Item 1 individually:

- Item 1 proportion: THB 1,000 ÷ THB 1,250 = 80%
- Cart discount for Item 1: 80% × THB 107.50 = THB 86
- Refund amount: THB 1,000 - THB 86 = THB 914
If you later refund Item 2:

- Item 2 proportion: THB 250 ÷ THB 1,250 = 20%
- Cart discount for Item 2: 20% × THB 107.50 = THB 21.50
- Refund amount: THB 250 - THB 21.50 = THB 228.50
Total individual refunds : THB 914 + THB 228.50 = THB 1,142.50 ✅
