🔍 Supabase Free Tier

Storage: Free = 1 GB → your 1.5 GB/month already exceeds the free limit.

Bandwidth: Free = 2 GB/month → if customers/staff view the images, bandwidth will exceed quickly (just a few hundred views).

✅ Good only for very small stores (<300–400 products).

❌ Not suitable for 1,000 products/month.

🔍 Cloudinary Free Tier

Credits: 25/month (each credit = 1 GB storage OR 1 GB bandwidth OR 1,000 transformations).

Storage needed: 1.5 GB = ≈ 2 credits.

Bandwidth: Let’s assume 10,000 customer views/month, each loading 5 images (≈15 MB per product page × 10,000 views = 150 GB bandwidth).

Free bandwidth = 25 GB → you’ll exceed if you have lots of online views.

But for POS only (staff-facing), traffic is much smaller, so 25 GB is plenty.

Transformations: Cloudinary can auto-generate thumbnails, compressions, etc. Even with 5,000 images, you’ll likely stay under 25,000 transformations (≈25 credits)
